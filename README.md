# Py2Java Converter (using Claude AI)

**Convert Python code to Java intelligently using Claude by Anthropic!**

This project provides a web UI that allows users to paste Python code and get an **AI-generated equivalent in Java**, powered by the **Claude API**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Convert Python scripts to idiomatic Java
- Uses **Anthropic Claude AI API** for accurate conversion
- Interactive web UI built with **Gradio**
- Syntax-aware conversion (not just text replacement)
- Designed for developers & learners

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user pastes Python code in the web UI.
2. The backend sends a prompt to **Claude API** asking for conversion.
3. Claude returns the equivalent Java code.
4. The output is displayed on the UI.

Claude is capable of understanding code logic and translating it into the target language while maintaining programming idioms and structure. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
